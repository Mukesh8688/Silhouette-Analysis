# Silhouette-Analysis

I am trying to explain tittle bit here on how to play more significant role in k-means clustering evaluation by silhouette analysis instead of elbow technique. As we know that K-means clustering is a simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. We can evaluate the algorithm by two ways . One is elbow technique and another is silhouette method. Here 
i described silhouette method by python code with some dummy example of data.
